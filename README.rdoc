= amazon-album-art

A specialized Amazon AWS gem for finding Album Art running on top of the 'sucker' gem

== INSTALLATION:

  gem install amazon-album-art
  
== USAGE:

Create a client

  client = AmazonAlbumArt.new('YOUR_ACCESS_KEY', 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY', 'YOUR_ASSOCIATE_TAG')

Search for all available image sizes

  client.search("phish", "rift")
  
Or search for a medium and large image

  client.search("phish", "rift", [:medium, :large])

These methods will return a hash with the found artist and album names along with URL's to the requested image sizes. Example: 

  { :artist => "Phish", :album => "Rift", :images => { :medium => "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511RmbQV7dL._SL160_.jpg", :large => "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511RmbQV7dL.jpg" } }

* TODO: offer options to return different image sets (Primary, Vibrant etc...)
